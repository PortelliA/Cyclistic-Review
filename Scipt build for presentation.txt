Script 1: Introduction "Welcome to the analysis of Cyclistic bike usage patterns. As a new member of the team, I'm thrilled to be part of this exciting journey. This presentation covers data from the start of our observations to the end, focusing on usage patterns and trends. I hope my observations and suggestions are received well."


Script 2: "The purpose of this analysis is to uncover trends within our current customer base and understand the differences between our casual riders and annual member riders. With these insights, we aim to provide three actionable decisions for the marketing team to act upon. I also sent an email earlier with a link to the Tableau dashboard, allowing you to drill down on key areas throughout the presentation."


Script 3: "In our analysis, a key limitation we encountered was the inability to accurately calculate the distance traveled for each trip. Since we only had start and end station data, this didn’t account for the actual routes taken. For example, riders could return the bike to the same location, which doesn't reflect the actual distance traveled.

Additionally, I performed extensive data cleansing, removing 1.6 million observations from the dataset. Notably, out of these, 54,000 trips were under 1 minute in length, indicating a high level of curiosity from casual riders who made up a high percentage of the count."


Script 4: Total Rides were just over 4 million and average duration 12minutes for members and 23 min for casuals. Members tend to take shorter, frequent rides while casual riders go for longer, leisurely trips."


Script 5: Bike Options Used "Classic bikes are the preferred choice for both casual and member riders, with members slightly favoring them more than casuals."

Script 6: Top 10 Start and End Locations for Members
 "In analyzing the top start and end locations for our members, we observe significant insights. Firstly, the top 10 start locations make up 7.36% of all member rides, while the top 10 end locations account for 7.44% of rides. This high concentration highlights frequent activity around business districts and residential areas. The peak usage times indicate significant commuting patterns, with consistent high traffic at main transport hubs, showcasing how our members integrate biking into their daily commutes
"

Script 7: Top 10 Start and End Locations for Casual Riders
"Turning to our casual riders, we see different patterns. Firstly, the top 10 start locations make up 14.56% of all casual rides, while the top 10 end locations account for 14.83% of rides. This suggests a strong preference for tourist spots and scenic areas. High usage at lakefront access points and popular attractions indicates that casual riders primarily use bikes for leisure and recreation, reflecting a different usage motivation compared to our member riders."



Script 8: Using the information from the previous findings, I want to turn your attention to ride density now to see if we can keep making the same correlation.

Script 9: At first glance for weekdays, we can see that Members have two interesting peaks being 8am and 5pm which can be correlated to "business hour starting/ending times". Also the times surrounding have more dramatic drop. While casuals peak is at 5pm with a more gradual drop and steady usage throughout the day while considering less counts. 

Script 10: On the other hand on the weekend. The split has different peaks from 12pm-4pm but similar to weekdays the drop between the peak is more gradual in casual & we have that same higher activity at 8am for members.


Script 11: Based on these observations, we seeing this correlating pattern in bike usage between members and casual riders. During the weekdays, 70.5% of total rides occur, within this count: members accounting for 69% of the rides and casual riders accounting for 31%. This indicates a higher usage by members during the week, potentially for commuting purposes, as evidenced by the peak times at 8am and 5pm. Casual riders, on the other hand, show increased activity post 11am with a similar peak at 5pm.

On weekends, 29.5% of the rides take place. Within this count with 55% of the rides are by members and 45% are by casual riders. The peak usage times are more relaxed, with most rides happening between 12-4pm, though members still show a notable peak at 8am, adding to previous suggestion that members might be using for commuting.

It's crucial to highlight that Saturday recorded the highest count of rides, underscoring a significant leisure or recreational use during weekends between both rider groups

Script 12: Now I want to turn your attention to seasonal trends of our riders, using the dashboard provided please toggle between the two options of member and casuals

Script 13: Both casual and member riders see a significant drop in bike usage during winter months, with casual riders dropping by 86% and members by 64%."

Script 14: Impact of Special Events "Interestingly, special biking events like Let's Ride Illinois and Apple Cider Century did not significantly impact bike usage. This is more evident paired with the seasonal findings, showing that while groups like the Chicago Cycling Club and Windy City Cycling Club host events throughout the year, including colder months, these events don’t seem to influence the data results significantly.

Script 15: Now, let's dive into some key suggestions based on our analysis. These recommendations aim to enhance our customer engagement, drive long-term membership, and optimize our marketing strategies. I'll walk you through three main areas: partnerships and sponsorships, app adoption, and distance tracking."

Script 16: Partnerships/Sponsorship with Local Clubs/Events
Script: "A big part of what makes leisure or sport activities engaging is the community aspect. Humans are social beings, and when they feel more involved in an activity, they are more likely to commit long-term, such as through annual memberships. Regular participation strengthens their sense of belonging and community ties, making them more invested in the activity. Our partnership opportunities are vast, given that our network has grown to 1,646 stations, over double the 692 stations in 2016, making site accessibility for events across the Chicago area substantial. Additionally, offering annual discounts to members of these clubs/events can further encourage engagement and long-term commitment."

Script 17: App Adoption
Script: "Much like fitness tracking, order tracking, or financial tracking on apps, we can introduce similar tracking processes for our customer base. Engaging users through an app that tracks their rides, accomplishments, and even community rankings can enhance their connection to the service. This engagement, as pointed out earlier, can make them more inclined to become long-term users and advocates for our services."

Script 18: Distance Tracking
Script: "Distance tracking is crucial and deserves a dedicated focus. One exciting feature we could introduce is displaying the total distance covered by all riders on our company website. This not only highlights the community’s collective effort but provides vital insights into customer behavior. More importantly since our bikes are already geotracked, enabling data retrieval on rider locations will provide better insights on where casual customers are going. This information can be invaluable for targeting advertisement locations and future promotions, tailoring our marketing strategy based on real-world usage patterns."

Script 19: Partnering with local clubs, app implementation & distance tracking; I believe these suggestions can provide Cyclistic a competitive edge in growing our annual membership through customer satisfaction and tailored marketing. Thank you for time today - I'm excited to see how these strategies can help Cyclistic and our riders!
